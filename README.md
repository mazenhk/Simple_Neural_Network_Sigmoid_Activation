# Simple_Neural_Network_Sigmoid_Activation
Simple Artificial Neural Network that uses Sigmoid function as its activation function and gradient descent to decrease error rate.

"x" are the the data to train on and "z" are the features.

You can change the epoch number by changing the range of the for loop.
